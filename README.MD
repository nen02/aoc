## 📅 About Advent of Code

**Advent of Code (AoC)** is an annual event with daily programming puzzles released every December.  
Each day from **December 1st to 25th**, a new two-part challenge appears — perfect for practicing algorithms, data structures, and creative problem-solving (with some holiday magic 🎅).
